# In the yellow box below, try getting accustomed to the mathematical operators by doing the following tasks.
# - [x] Add 2 and 3 using the + operator.
print(2+3)
# - [ ] Substract 10 from 3 using the - operator.
print(10-3)
# - [ ] Multiply 5 times 6 using the * operator.
print(5*6)
# - [ ] Divide 1 by 2 using the / operator.
print(1/2)
# - [ ] Divide 3 by 2 using the // (integer division) operator. (Addon: Can you figure out the difference between / and // operator?).
print(3//2)
# - [ ] Get the remainder by after dividing 11 by 5 using the % operator.
print(11%5)
# - [ ] Raise 2 to the power of 3 by using the ** operator.
print(2**3)
# - [x] Bonus question: Try taking two numbers as inputs and store 
# them in 2 variables and then add them and print the result.
number1=1
number2=2
result=number1+number2
print("Result of addition", result)
# - [ ] Do the following operation: 2 ** 3 + 5 - 2. Can you figure out which operation was done first and which was done last?
#---->2 to the power of tree, is carried out first
# - [ ] As a disclaimer, try defining two string (alphabet) variables, like, string_1 = ’Hello’ and string_2 = ’World’ and try using the + , - , * operators on them. Check what happens!
string1='hello'
string2='World'
print(string1 + "---"+ string2)

# Try out yourself some of the ways of using logical operators.
# - [ ] Set a variable, x to True, then print out the not(x).
x = False
print(not(x))
# - [ ] Create another variable y and set it to False. Print the value of x and y.
y= False
print (x and y)
# - [ ] Using the same variables print the value of x or y.
print(x or y)
# - [ ] Bonus Question: Try using all the three logical operators in a equation and try to figure out which operator works first and which one operates last.
